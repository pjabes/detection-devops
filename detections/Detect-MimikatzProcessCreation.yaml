    description: "This detection is used to detect Windows process creation with well-known Mimikatz process names."
    intention: "Mimikatz is a leading post-exploitation tool that dumps passwords from memory, as well as hashes, PINs and Kerberos tickets and usage is a high fidelity indicator adversary action."
    known_falsepositives: 
        - "None"
    blindspots:
        - "For the limited scope of this detection, only process names matching Mimikatz are searched again."
        - "Not all of the endpoints have process creation events on them."
    dependencies:
        LPs: 
            - "LP_0001_windows_audit_process_creation.yml"
        HPs:
